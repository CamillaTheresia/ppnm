I have done exam project number 7, because my student's number ends with '07'.

I have done all parts of the project (Cholesky-Banachiewicz decomposition, linear equation solver,
calculating the determinant and calculation of the inverse matrix.)


Because of this, I would give myself 10/10 for the examination project.
